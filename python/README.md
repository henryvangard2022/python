Hi, all --

1.  The "MYSQL Connector Python" folder contains codes that implement CRUD operations on a customer DB in MySQL.

2.  The "selenium projects" folder contains codes that implement the automation for ordering computers/parts on the CDW.com.

3.  The "FASTAPI" folder further extends the CRUD operations on a customer DB into a webservice.  (This is in the FAST API repository.)

More to come.

Thanks!
